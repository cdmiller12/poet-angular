## Running the Application:
This repository is set up to work with github codespaces. To start development, create a new github codespace on this repository and give the devcontainer time to set up. Once all commands are given time to complete, the codespace will automatically serve the application. You can go to "ports" tab at the bottom of the codespace. There will be a link to port 4300. Click on that link and it will take you to a running version of the application.

You can also run this application locally if you have node, npm, and angular installed. To serve the application, run the command "npm start" at the base of the repository.
